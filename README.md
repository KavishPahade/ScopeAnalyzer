Scope_Analyzer
==============

Developed a scope analyzer tool which analyzes a set of source code files at an specified path and computes the complexities of all the functions present in each of the files analyzed. The tool also determines the function with maximum complexities in each file and creates a XML representation of all scopes present in the function with line no for each scope.
